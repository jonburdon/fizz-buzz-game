# FizzBuzz Game - Test Driven Development Demonstration

## Red Green Refactor philosophy

This javascript game accepts a number input. If the number is a multiple of 3, it returns Fizz, if a multiple of 5 it returns Buzz. 
If a common multiple of 3 and 5 it returns FizzBuzz. If neither, it returns the number. The project uses a suite of Jasmine tests to verify that the logic of the FizzBuzz game works correctly.
